Vertic HTML boilerplate
=======================

This is Vertic's internal base boilerplate for new front-end projects. We use this for almost all the HTML projects we create, and it is, as such, very much an internal tool.

However, everything in it is open source. That means that you are more than welcome to look, get inspired, [copy/steal](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso#Unsourced) from everything you see here. Also, if you see anything that you think is odd (or even wrong), please let us know!

A few notes on structure
------------------------

This boilerplate is created to fit our needs - and therefore might require some short notes:

* We build our CSS with [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) using [Web Workbench](http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench) for Visual Studio.
* We try to build everything [modular](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki). That means that everything is packed into it's own SCSS or Respond.js JavaScript file.
